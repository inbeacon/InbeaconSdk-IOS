You can integrate the SDK using [_CocoaPods_](https://cocoapods.org/) or [_Carthage_](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) dependency managers or download the framework directly from the [_repository_](https://github.com/inbeacon/InbeaconSdk-IOS).

**_Cocoapods_** is the preferred way to integrate, as this will minimize additional steps.

* [Install with CocoaPods](install-with-cocoapods.md)
* [Install with Carthage](install-with-carthage.md)
* [Install without CocoaPods or Carthage](install-without-cocoapods-or-carthage.md)
